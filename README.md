# 📘 Fashion MNIST Classification

## 📝 Introduction
This project implements a **Fashion MNIST Classification** system using the **MNIST dataset**. The model is trained to recognize Fashion objects like shirts,shoes,trousers etc. based on grayscale images of clothes. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for image recognition tasks.
